# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue
The Vercel deployment was failing with a TypeScript error:
```
src/components/Footer.tsx(383,9): error TS6133: 'currentYear' is declared but its value is never read.
```

## Solution
The issue was in the Footer component where a variable `currentYear` was declared but not used. Instead, `new Date().getFullYear()` was being called directly in the JSX.

### Fix Applied
1. Modified `src/components/Footer.tsx` to use the declared `currentYear` variable instead of calling `new Date().getFullYear()` directly in the JSX.

2. Removed `package-lock.json` to avoid yarn warnings about mixed package managers.

## Verification
- Ran `npm run build` successfully
- Ran `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify no TypeScript errors
- The build now completes without errors

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Enable TypeScript's `noUnusedLocals` compiler option to catch unused variables
2. Run TypeScript checks regularly during development
3. Use consistent package managers (yarn or npm, not both)
